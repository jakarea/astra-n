On the Integration Page, display cards similar to CRM modules. Below, list all integrated webshops with their name, total orders, and revenue, allowing the user to view details, edit, or delete entries.

For adding a new webshop, open a modal form (using Shadcn UI) with fields: Webshop Name, Shop Type (WordPress, Shopify, etc.), Domain, Base URL, and supported action types (e.g., order created, updated, deleted, shippedâ€”based on the selected shop type). The webhook_secret will auto-populate from the users table, not from user input.

In the listing section, show all integrations with their webhook_secret and delivery URL, each with a copy button. Both create and edit webhook should also be handled inside modals.

Finally, always ensure the form fields and database schema are in sync. If mismatches occur, apply a Prisma schema update with a one-time migration, so that future prisma db reset and prisma db push remain consistent without manual fixes.


there should be a search option like crm need also sort by totla order, revenue and etc
do not use fetch, call directly from component. this full module will be for authenticated user
